This is the firmware source code used by MT3X. Temporarily put it in this position, it will change its position in the future.

This firmware is common to MT3S. But to change to MT3S, two settings are required.

There are three main files in the directory,
```
/Marlin/multoo_config.h
It is function control.
```
```
/Marlin/src/module/mdxc.cpp
/Marlin/src/module/mdxc.h
They are functional realizations.
```

You can directly compile the MT3X firmware.
